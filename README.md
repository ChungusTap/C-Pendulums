#The Compound Double Pendulum
This is simulation of a Compound Double Pendulum. It's C++ under the hood with a python wrapper over it to make it as easy as possible to use.

#Installation
You need Python 3 to run the code, so download that before you try to do so. Other than that, there is nothing else you really need to do to run the code other than to run the command "python3 visualize_pendulum.py" (at least that's what I have to do).

#Usage
The SPACEBAR key is used to STOP AND START the pendulum, please note that when you use it for simulation.
